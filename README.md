# speech_enabled_chatbot
a Streamlit app that allows the user to provide either text or speech input to the chatbot. If the user provides text input, the chatbot should function as normal. If the user provides speech input, the speech recognition algorithm should transcribe the speech into text, which is then passed to the chatbot. The chatbot's response should be displayed to the user.
